General-User-Drums
==================

General-MIDI drums are very convenient. Most standard drum-sounds are in the
patches and the sounds are always on the same key, so one can switch between
different patches.

These drums are taken from the great [GeneralUser
GS](https://schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php) soundfont. Converted using
[ConvertWithMoss](http://www.mossgrabers.de/Software/SampleConverter/SampleConverter.html)

The licensing of the orginal work applies.



Complete General-MIDI soundfonts
--------------------------------

I won't distribute the complete soundfont because:

* Not all patches can be faithfully converted
* Bitwig has currently no way to [deduplicate](https://github.com/bitwig/multisample/issues/4)
  the contained sounds
* Copyright and stuff

However you can convert the soundfonts yourself:

* Download [ConvertWithMoss](http://www.mossgrabers.de/Software/SampleConverter/SampleConverter.html)
* Download the [soundfonts](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/wiki/SoundFont)
  * [GeneralUser GS](https://schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php)
  * [FluidSynth](https://packages.debian.org/sid/fluid-soundfont-gm)
    * Download fluid-soundfont_X.Y.orig.tar.gz
* Follow the manual of ConvertWithMoss

** License of the complete work **
You may use GeneralUser GS without restriction for your own music creation,
private or commercial.  This SoundFont bank is provided to the community free of
charge.  Please feel free to use it in your software projects, and to modify the
SoundFont bank or its packaging to suit your needs.

** License of contained samples **
GeneralUser GS inherits the usage rights of the samples contained within, all of
which allow full use in music production, including the ability to make profit
from musical recordings created with GeneralUser GS.

Many of the samples are original, but some were taken from other banks freely
(and legally) available on the Internet from various SoundFont websites.
Because GeneralUser GS originated as a personal project with no intention for
publication, I cannot be 100% sure where all of the samples originated, although
I do know that none of them came from commercially published SoundFont packages
or sample CDs.  Regardless, many "free" SoundFonts available on the web may
indeed contain samples of questionable origin.  My understanding of the
copyrights of all samples is only as good as the information provided by the
original sources. If you become aware of any restricted samples being used in
GeneralUser GS, please let me know so I can replace them.

This uncertainty may concern you if you intend to use GeneralUser GS in a
commercial software product.  That being said, I have never received any
complaint regarding sample ownership since I published the original GeneralUser
GS back in 2000, and as far as I am aware, neither have any of the companies
creating commercial software products using GeneralUser GS.

** More info **
If you plan to feature GeneralUser GS on your own website, please do not link
directly to my download files.  Either link to my website, or provide your own
local copy instead.

I hope you enjoy GeneralUser GS!  This SoundFont bank is the product of many
years of hard work.
